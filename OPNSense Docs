Absolutely Jesse! Here's a clean and professional markdown documentation you can upload to your GitHub to showcase your **OPNsense Static Route & PAT configuration** project.

You can name the file something like `README.md` for your repo:

# 🔐 OPNsense Firewall: Static Route & PAT Configuration

This project documents the process of configuring **PAT (Port Address Translation)** and **Static Routes** on an OPNsense firewall to enable internal network devices to access the internet and route traffic to remote networks through another router.

---

## 🧱 Network Topology Overview

- **LAN Subnet**: `192.168.80.128/26`
- **WAN Interface IP**: `192.168.122.28/24`
- **INTRT2 Interface IP**: `192.168.0.10/31` *(Point-to-point link)*
- **NAT Mode**: Hybrid
- **Goal**: Enable internet access for LAN clients using PAT and route to a remote network via static route.

---

## 🌐 PAT Configuration (Outbound NAT)

1. Navigate to: `Firewall > NAT > Outbound`
2. Set NAT Mode to: **Hybrid Outbound NAT rule generation**
3. Click **Add** to create a rule:
   - **Interface**: `WAN`
   - **Source Network**: `192.168.80.128/26`
   - **Translation / target**: `Interface address`
   - **Description**: `PAT for LAN subnet`

4. Save and Apply Changes

---

## 🔐 Firewall Rule for LAN (INTRT2 Interface)

1. Go to: `Firewall > Rules > INTRT2`
2. Add a new rule:
   - **Action**: Pass
   - **Protocol**: Any
   - **Source**: `192.168.80.128/26`
   - **Destination**: Any
   - **Description**: `Allow LAN to WAN`

3. Move the rule to the top if needed
4. Save and Apply Changes

---

## 🛰️ WAN Gateway Configuration

1. Go to: `System > Routing > Gateways`
2. Add new gateway:
   - **Interface**: WAN
   - **Gateway IP**: (e.g., `192.168.122.1`)
   - **Mark as Default Gateway**: ✅

3. Save and Apply

---

## 🧭 Static Route Configuration

### Use case: Route traffic to remote network `192.168.90.0/24` via next-hop `192.168.80.1`.

1. Go to: `System > Routing > Gateways`
   - Create a gateway with:Can you help me with some documentation so i can post in my GitHub account
     - **Interface**: INTRT2
     - **Name**: `GW_to_90net`
     - **Gateway IP**: `192.168.80.1`

2. Go to: `System > Routing > Static Routes`
   - Add a static route:
     - **Destination Network**: `192.168.90.0/24`
     - **Gateway**: `GW_to_90net`

3. Apply changes.

## 🧪 Diagnostics & Testing

- **Ping Test**: From OPNsense (Diagnostics > Ping) and LAN client
- **Traceroute**: Ensure traffic flows via the intended next-hop
- **Firewall Logs**: Use Live View to monitor accepted/blocked traffic

---

## 🧰 Additional Notes

- Ensure WAN gateway is **reachable** and marked as default.
- Enable under `Firewall > Settings > Advanced`:
  - ✅ Disable reply-to on WAN rules
  - ✅ Bypass firewall rules for traffic on the same interface
- PAT must be complemented by correct **firewall rules and routing** for full communication.
